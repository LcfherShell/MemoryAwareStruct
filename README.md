#MemoryAwareStruct
MemoryAwareStruct is a class designed to manage data in the form of a dictionary in a safe and efficient way in terms of memory usage. It also supports multi-threaded access.

##Features

1. Memory Management: MemoryAwareStruct features effective memory management, so as to prevent memory exhaustion and ensure that the stored data does not 2. exceed the specified memory limit.
3. Multi-Threaded Access: MemoryAwareStruct can be accessed by multiple threads securely, so it can be used in applications that require fast and secure data access.
4. Data Management: This class has effective data management features, making it easy to manage stored data.

##Use Cases

MemoryAwareStruct can be used as temporary data storage, such as:

1. Cache: MemoryAwareStruct can be used as a cache to store frequently accessed data.
2.  
Session Data: MemoryAwareStruct can be used to store session data that does not need to be stored persistently.
3.   
Temporary Data: MemoryAwareStruct can be used to store data that only needs to be stored temporarily.

##Keep in mind

MemoryAwareStruct is not designed for persistent data storage.   
If you need persistent data storage, then you may need to use another data storage solution, such as a database or file system.

##Advantages

1. Effective Memory Management: MemoryAwareStruct can prevent memory exhaustion and ensure that the stored data does not exceed the specified memory limit.
2. Secure Multi-Threaded Access:   
MemoryAwareStruct can be accessed by multiple threads securely, so it can be used in applications that require fast and secure data access.
3. Effective Data Management: This class features effective data management, making it easy to manage the stored data.

##Disadvantages

1. Not Designed for Persistent Data Storage: MemoryAwareStruct is not designed for persistent data storage, so it cannot be used as a persistent data storage solution.
